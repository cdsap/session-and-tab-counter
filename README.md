# Running agent tracker

Desktop utility (Compose for Desktop, dark Material 3 UI) that lists **terminal / CLI agent processes**: **PID**, **cwd**, **`ps` uptime / CPU / RSS**, and scheduler **state**. **Claude Desktop** (the `.app` GUI) is **intentionally ignored** so the list matches “what’s running in the shell.” **Model / max-token hints** are **best-effort**: regex scan of local JSON (e.g. `~/.claude/settings.json`, project `.claude/settings.local.json`, Cursor `settings.json`) plus `--model` on the command line—not live token counts from the model API.

## Who gets detected

Processes whose command line matches heuristics in `RunningAgents.kt` (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, Cursor, etc.). Claude Code is matched on many argv shapes (`claude` on `PATH`, `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `node`/`npx`/`bun` wrappers, etc.); if yours still does not appear, run `ps axww | grep -i claude`, note the exact `args` column, and add a regex in `RunningAgents.kt`.

**Idle / waiting** is normal: most agent processes sleep between I/O and tool calls. **Active** (`R`) may appear only briefly in a 5s snapshot.

## Requirements

- **JDK 17+**
- **macOS** or **Linux** for `ps` and cwd resolution (`lsof` on macOS for cwd when `/proc` is not used)

If **cwd** stays unknown or wrong, the tracker process must be allowed to inspect others: on macOS grant **Full Disk Access** (or equivalent) to the JVM/terminal running the app so `lsof` can read cwd; on Linux run as a user that can read `/proc/<pid>/cwd` and run `lsof`.
